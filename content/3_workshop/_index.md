In this workshop, we will demonstrate DevOps in the cloud with GKE and JFrog. We will build and deploy a containerized NPM application. Using the JFrog Platform, JFrog CLI and Google Cloud Build, we will compile our code, build our NPM package, execute a docker build and push, security scan the image and publish it to a repository. We will then deploy the image and serve the application with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
