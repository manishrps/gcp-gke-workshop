   ![Xray Watch Add Policy](../../../docs/images/xray-watch-add-policy.png)

9. Click **Save**.

10. Click **Create** to create the new watch. We have now configured Xray to scan our new Docker repository for security violations.

> **Note** Xray Watches are the focal point for viewing and managing your security and license violations in the JFrog Platform. Watches provide you with the flexibility you need to meet your specific security and violation requirements. You select the resources you would like to scan for security vulnerabilities and compliance and determine the actions to be taken once a security vulnerability is detected.
