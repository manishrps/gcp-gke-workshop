Next, we will configure Xray to index our new Docker repository. This allows Xray to automatically analyze all the artifacts in this repository.

1. Let's configure Xray to index the new Docker repository automatically. Go to **Administration** â–º **Xray Security & Compliance**.

   ![Config Xray](../../../docs/images/config-xray.png)

2. Click on **Indexed Resources**.

3. Click on **Add a Repository** on the right.

   ![Xray Add Repo](../../../docs/images/xray-add-repo.png)

4. Move the _clouddays_ repository into the **Included Repositories**.

    ![Config Indexed Repo](../../../docs/images/config-indexed-repo.png)

5. Click **Save**. You have now configured Xray to index the _clouddays_ repository.
