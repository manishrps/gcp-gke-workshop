In this workshop, we used Google Cloud Build to build JFrog CLI, then used the JFrog Platform to build an application, manage the artifacts, scan the artifacts for security vulnerabilities and license compliance, and publish the artifacts of your application to a staging repository. Then we used Google GKE to deploy your application so that end-users can access it. 
The JFrog Platform and Google Cloud demonstrate how you can build a DevOps cloud platform to delivery your software to your end-users. This modernizes your software delivery life cycle enabling your organization to deliver quality software continuously by leveraging advanced cloud services and infrastructure.
